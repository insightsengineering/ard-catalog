# Overview

The current procedure for generating clinical reporting tables employs
NEST packages such as {rtables}, {tern} and {chevron}. These packages
create complex table structures and generate statistics that should be
programmatically compared. This repository provides a collection of Quality 
Control (QC) workflows for common clinical trial outputs. Statistics calculated 
using the {rtables} based suite of packages are compared against statistics 
returned in a Analysis Result Dataset (ARD) using the {cards} and {cardx} packages.

## QCing Workflow

The workflow can be generalized into the following steps:

1.  Flattening the {rtables} output into a data.frame. The data.frame
    has one line per statistics that appears in the summary table.
    
2.  Create a comparable Analysis Result Dataset (ARD), with a similar
    structure: one line per statistic.

3.  We then modify/reformat each of the data.frames to have the same structure.

4.  Compare both data.frames to QC each result in the table.
