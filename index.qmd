# Overview

The current procedure for generating clinical reporting tables employs
NEST packages such as {rtables}, {tern} and {chevron}. These packages
create complex table structures and generate statistics that should be
programmatically compared.

In this document, we will showcase how the {cards} and {cardx} packages
can be used to QC common outputs generated using NEST packages.
