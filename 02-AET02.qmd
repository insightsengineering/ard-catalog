## Building an AET02 table using the {chevron} package


```{r}
#| message: false
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

library(chevron)
aet02 <- run(aet02, syn_data)
aet02

```


## Building an AET02 table using the {cards} package

In this example below we perform different data pre-processing for the different ARDs we want to create. 
We then generate separate ARDs for the different sections of the AET02 table and then merge them all together. 

```{r}
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

library(cards)

```

## Comparing Outputs
Upon comparing the two outputs, it's evident that both methods yield identical values, enabling their use for Quality Control (QC) purposes.
